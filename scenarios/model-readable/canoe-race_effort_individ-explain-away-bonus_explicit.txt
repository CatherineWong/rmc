BACKGROUND
In this event, the athletes are competing in a series of canoe races.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.
All matches take place on the same day.

Intrinsic strength varies widely from athlete to athlete.
The stronger the athlete, the faster they can individually row.
Athletes also vary in how often they try their hardest in any given race.
If an athlete doesnâ€™t try hard in any given match, that athlete only rows about half as quickly as they could.
Each canoe team moves as fast as the average effective speed of all of its athletes in that race.
The canoe team that is the fastest will win a given race.
