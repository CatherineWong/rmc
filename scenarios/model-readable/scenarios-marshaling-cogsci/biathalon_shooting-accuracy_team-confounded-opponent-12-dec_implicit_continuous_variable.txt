BACKGROUND
In this event, teams of players are competing in rounds of a biathalon, a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing races and rifle shooting. In each round, the team that wins depends on the average speed with which the athletes are able to ski, based on their intrinsic strength, as well as each team member's shooting accuracy in that particular round.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.
All matches take place on the same day.
