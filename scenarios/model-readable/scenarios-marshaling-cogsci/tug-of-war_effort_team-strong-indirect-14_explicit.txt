BACKGROUND
In this event, the athletes are competing in matches of tug-of-war.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.
All matches take place on the same day.

Intrinsic strength varies widely from athlete to athlete.
Athletes also vary in how often they try their hardest in any given match.
If an athlete doesnâ€™t try hard in any given match, that athlete only pulls with half of their intrinsic strength in that match.
Each team pulls as hard as the total effective strength of all of its athletes in that match.
The team that pulls the hardest will win a given match.

CONDITIONS
In the first match, Drew and Quinn lost to Kay and Ness.
In the second match, Quinn and Jamie beat Kay and Ness.
In the third match, Quinn and Ollie beat Kay and Ness.
