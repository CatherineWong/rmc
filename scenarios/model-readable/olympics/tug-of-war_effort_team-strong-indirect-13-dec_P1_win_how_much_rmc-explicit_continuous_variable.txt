BACKGROUND
The athletes in this tournament have very different <b>strengths</b>.
The athletes also put in different amounts of <b>effort into <i>each match</i></b>. In general, stronger athletes usually put in more effort, but effort really comes down to chance for each match.
How hard <b>an athlete pulls</b> in each match depends on <b>both strength and effort</b>. They'll pull harder with more effort, and less hard with less effort.
Then, how <b>an entire team of athletes pulls</b> depends on the total amount that all the athletes pull in that match.
In tug-of-war, a team <b>beats</b> another if they pull harder in that match.
A team <b>loses</b> to another if they pull less hard than the other team in that match.
We will ask you to imagine how an athlete <b>ranks in terms of strength</b>. You should imagine how they would compare to a bunch of other random athletes, without taking effort into account.
We will also ask you to imagine the results of <b>fantasy matches between new teams</b>. You should imagine the teams competing against each other, and then tell us which one you think is <b>more likely to win</b>.

CONDITIONS
In the first match, Robin and Indiana <b>beat</b> Kay and Emery.
In the second match, Indiana and Quinn <b>lost to</b> Kay and Emery.
In the third match, Indiana and Ollie <b>lost to</b> Kay and Emery.

QUERIES
Query 1: Out of 100 random athletes, where do you think Robin ranks in terms of <b>overall strength</b>?
Query 2: On a percentage scale from 0 to 100%, how much <b>effort</b> do you think Robin put into the <b>second match</b>?
Query 3: In a new match later this same day between Robin and Indiana (Team 1) and Quinn and Kay (Team 2), which team would be <b>more likely to win></b>?
