BACKGROUND
Athletes vary a lot in how <b>strong</b> they are overall. Some athletes are very strong, most are average, and some are weak. This doesn't change throughout the course of the day.
One part of this sport involves skiing. Stronger athletes can ski faster than weaker athletes.
Another part of this sport involves shooting. Athletes also vary a lot in how <b>accurate at shooting a rifle</b> they tend to be in any given round. Stronger and more experienced athletes also tend to be more accurate than weaker and less experienced athletes.
In each round, teams of athletes compete in a skiing race, followed by a target shooting round. Athletes receive a score for how fast they ski, and how accurate they are at shooting in that round. The team's <b>overall score</b> in each round is determined by total scores of the athletes on the team.
The team that completes the biathlon round with the highest score <b>beats</b> the other team.
The team that completes the biathlon round with the lowest score <b>loses</b> to the other team.
When we ask you about an athlete's <b>overall strength ranking</b>, you should imagine a set of random other walk-ons -- how many would this athlete be <b>stronger</b> than?
Finally, when we ask you to imagine a new biathlon round later this same day, you should imagine the two teams competing against each other and tell us which one you think is <b>more likely to win</b>.

CONDITIONS
In the first round, Ollie and Ness <b>beat</b> Jamie and Avery.
In the second round, Ollie and Ness <b>beat</b> Emery and Drew.
In the third round, Ollie and Ness <b>beat</b> Robin and Gale.
In the fourth round, Ollie and Ness <b>lost to</b> Jamie and Avery.

QUERIES
Query 1: Out of 100 random athletes, where do you think Ollie ranks in terms of <b>overall strength</b>?
Query 2: On a percentage scale from 0 to 100%, how <b>accurate></b> do you think Ollie was at shooting in the <b>fourth round</b>?
Query 3: In a new round later this same day between Ollie and Ness (Team 1) and Jamie and Gale (Team 2), which team would be <b>more likely to win></b>?
