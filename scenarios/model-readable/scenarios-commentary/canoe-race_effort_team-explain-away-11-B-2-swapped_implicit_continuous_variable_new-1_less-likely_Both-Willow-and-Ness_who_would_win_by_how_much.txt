BACKGROUND
In this event, the athletes are competing in a series of canoe races. In each race, the team that wins depends on the average speed with which the athletes are able to row, based on their intrinsic strength modulated by other factors including how much effort they put in to that race.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.
All matches take place on the same day.

CONDITIONS
In the first match, Indiana and Drew beat Sam and Val.
In the second match, Indiana and Gale beat Sam and Emery.
In the third match, Indiana and Taylor beat Sam and Lane.

You can see Indiana seems to be experiencing much more fatigue which set in for their last match.
Sam on the other hand seems to have caught a second wind.
