BACKGROUND
In this event, teams of players are competing in rounds of a synchronized diving tournament. The overall dive difficulty attempted by any given team is determined by the least skilled athlete on the team. In each round of a synchronized dive, the team's overall score depends on their dive difficulty and how well matched the team members are in their execution in that particular round.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.
All matches take place on the same day.
