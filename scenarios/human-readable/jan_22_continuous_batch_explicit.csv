Each tournament consists of a series of rounds.
In each round, athletes compete on teams. In a biathlon, each athlete first skis a short distance, then shoots at a target.
Athletes are scored based on how fast they ski and how accurately they shoot. An athlete’s ability to ski is based on their intrinsic strength. Note that an athlete’s intrinsic strength remains constant throughout a tournament. An athlete neither gets stronger nor weaker between rounds. You can assume that all matches take place on the same day.
An athlete’s ability to shoot accurately is unrelated to their intrinsic strength. An athlete who is intrinsically strong may be a very good shooter, a very bad shooter, or something in between. Athlete’s shooting accuracy in any given round is also somewhat down to chance.
A team’s overall score is determined by the sum of the scores for each athlete per event. Ski performance and shooting accuracy are weighted equally. Athletes receive more points for skiing faster and more points for achieving a high shooting accuracy.
The team that completes the course with the highest score wins.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.

Athletes are scored based on how fast they ski in a given round, and an athlete’s ability to ski is based on their intrinsic strength.
An athlete's shooting accuracy varies from round to round -- an athlete may be a very good shooter, a very bad shooter, or something in between, and an athlete's shooting accuracy in any given round is also somewhat down to chance; intuitively, accuracy probably varies as a function of intrinsic strength, because strong athletes tend to be better shots and weaker athletes who are less experienced in biathalon tend to miss lots of the shots they take.

Each tournament consists of a series of matches. In each match, athletes compete as part of a team.
An athlete’s intrinsic strength remains constant throughout a tournament. An athlete neither gets stronger nor weaker between matches. You can assume that all matches take place on the same day.
Athletes also vary in the effort that they put into any given match. Most of the time, people pull with a moderately high amount of effort. Sometimes, an athlete won’t put in much effort and will pull with only a fraction of their strength. Other times, they may put in a lot of effort and pull extra hard, beyond what their intrinsic strength would suggest.
How hard a team pulls overall in any given match is determined by the total amount that all of the athletes on the team pull in that match. How hard each athlete pulls in a given match is determined by their intrinsic strength, modified by how much effort they put in (a lower fraction of their intrinsic strength if they don’t put in much effort, or even more than their strength if they put in more effort).
